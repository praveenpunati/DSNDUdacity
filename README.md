# StackOver flow data results
Lets Review what we see in stack over flow data trends from last couple years

we will use data available from 2011 to 2020 survey results from across the globe and address business problem solutions



Lets provide some insights from the data available by using Exploratory data analysis using python and jupyter note book.

You can find complete python code from my github url 

Lets Review 3 key elements with in the data

1 ) Survey questions 

Over the period starting from 2011 to 2020 format of response collection is different hence analyzing this type of data will be difficult as there are very few common question across the years .

Also see that from latest years trend is leaning towards more work life balance and social media related question we need to wait for couple years to better understand these .

Survey questions needs to be streamlined for questions that are being replaced keep them and collect survey results as zero response

2) Respondents  regions or countries 

from the data we see top 4 contributors are from USA , India, UnitedKingdom an canda however recent trend suggests that lot of users are coming from Germany as well along with India reaching to second spot

3) Responses

when it comes to responses see USA and India all the way into top spots however for year 6 UK came to top2 



Also we can perform deep analytics into this data by profession , age ,income and i will encourage you to start with my note book which can be found in github link
